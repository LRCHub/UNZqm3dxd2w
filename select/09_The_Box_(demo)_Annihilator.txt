I am a box, I am a screen
I'm every nightmare, I'm every dream
I am the window over your land
So turn me on, come take my hand, yeah

Don't push me
Don't push me
Don't push me
Don't push

I offer you scandal, I offer wealth
Of gratuitous violence, hazardous to your health
I give the vision of what life should be
I choose your heroes, come follow me, follow me

Come follow me

Don't push me
Don't push me
Don't push me
Don't push

It's just a box, it's just a screen
It's only a nightmare, it's only a dream
We give the vision of how life should be
We choose our own heroes, come follow me, yeah

Don't push me
Don't push me
Don't push me
Don't push
